                    <h1>The story of a young man...</h1>
                    <p >
                       Long long ago, there lived a boy who had just completed his SEE. The board-exam was over and the vacation was on. So, like any other student he was completely wasting his time when he was expected to study for grade-11 or simply study brigde-course. Disobeying his parents, he didn't even study for the entire vacation. But as you can guess, it was just the silence before the strom because he had to apply for different collages for his upcomming studies. The boy was totally stubborn about not going anywhere he had to go out and fill up the forms himself. Insted of filling the forms, he just made excuses in front of his parents and did not apply in any collages. Those lies were later regretted by our founding member the boy himself (Mr. Ram). So, in-order to help other lazy ones like him, he came up with a great idea and established " appLIE ".
